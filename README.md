This is definately not the projects I'm working on.
Most of the projects I have are production applications and I'm won't be able to share these code publicly.
This is the sample architectural implementation of MVVM model in flutter with getX as state management tool.
I do have great knowledge of provider as state management tool and I'm also familier with clean architecture.
